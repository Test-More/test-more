This is the README file for Test::Simple, basic utilities for 
writing tests, by Michael G Schwern <schwern@pobox.com>. Maintained by Chad
Granum <exodist@cpan.org>.

After installation, please consult the tutorial for how to
start adding tests to your modules. 'perldoc Test::Tutorial'
should work on most systems.

* Installation

Test::Simple uses the standard perl module install process:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

It requires Perl version 5.8.1 or newer and Test::Harness 2.03 or newer.
