=head1 NAME

TB2::DebugOnFail - Enter the debugger on failure

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use TB2::DebugOnFail;
    use Test::Simple tests => 3;

    ok(1);
    ok(0);  # if run with -d you will enter the debugger
    ok(1);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A demonstration of writing an EventHandler using C<accept_result> to
drop you into the debugger when an assert fails.

=head1 CAVEATS

You have to run the test in the debugger.

You'll wind up at the end of the DebugOnFail assert_end wrapper.  You
can hit 'r' a few times to get back to your test, or examine the
$result object.  It would be nice if it could start the debugger just
after the assert was called instead.
