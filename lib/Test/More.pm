=head1 NAME

Test::More::Legacy - yet another framework for writing test scripts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this module is to provide a wide range of testing
utilities.  Various ways to say "ok" with better diagnostics,
facilities to skip tests, test future features and compare complicated
data structures.  While you can do almost anything with a simple
C<ok()> function, it doesn't provide good diagnostic output.

See L<Test::More::Legacy> for the original documentation and implementation
of this library. If you decide to use an engine other than the default 'Legacy'
you should see that engines documentation as it may change things.
