=head1 NAME

Test::Builder - Backend for building test libraries

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package My::Test::Module;
  use base 'Test::Builder::Module';

  my $CLASS = __PACKAGE__;

  sub ok {
      my($test, $name) = @_;
      my $tb = $CLASS->builder;

      $tb->ok($test, $name);
  }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::Simple and Test::More have proven to be popular testing modules,
but they're not always flexible enough.  Test::Builder provides a
building block upon which to write your own test libraries I<which can
work together>.

=head2 Construction

=over 4

=item B<new>

  my $Test = Test::Builder->new;

Returns a Test::Builder object representing the current state of the
test.

Since you only run one test per program, C<new()> always returns the same
Test::Builder object.  No matter how many times you call C<new()>, you're
getting the same object.  This is called the default.  This is done so that
multiple modules share such global information as the test counter and
where test output is going.

If you want a completely new Test::Builder object different from the
default, use C<create()>.

=cut

our $Test;

sub new {
    my($class) = shift;
    $Test ||= $class->_make_default;
    return $Test;
}

# Bit of a hack to make the default TB1 object use the history default.
sub _make_default {
    my $class = shift;

    my $obj = $class->create;
    $obj->{TestState} = TB2::TestState->default;
    $obj->{TestState}->add_early_handlers(
        TB2::OnlyOnePlan->new
    );

    return $obj;
}

=item B<create>

  my $Test = Test::Builder->create;

Ok, so there can be more than one Test::Builder object and this is how
you get it.  You might use this instead of C<new()> if you're testing
a Test::Builder based module, but otherwise you probably want C<new>.

B<NOTE>: the implementation is not complete.  C<level>, for example, is
still shared amongst B<all> Test::Builder objects, even ones created using
this method.  Also, the method name may change in the future.

Returns true if a test has started and not finished.

Testing has begun when a plan is issued or a test is run.  Testing has
ended when C<done_testing> is called or the process is exiting.

=cut

sub in_test {

=item B<reset>

  $Test->reset;

Reinitializes the Test::Builder default to its original state.
Mostly useful for tests run in persistent environments where the same
test might be run multiple times in the same process.

Returns the L<TB2::TestState> representing the test $builder is working with.

There may be other builders contributing to the same $state.

=cut

Change what $formatter is used to output the test.

Note that this changes the $formatter for the entire test state, not just this $builder.

Returns an identifier for this object unique to the running process.
The identifier is fairly simple and easily predictable.

=head2 Setting up tests

These methods are for setting up tests and declaring how many there
are.  You usually only want to call one of these methods.

=over 4

=item B<plan>

  $Test->plan('no_plan');
  $Test->plan( skip_all => $reason );
  $Test->plan( tests => $num_tests );

A convenient way to set up your tests.  Call this and Test::Builder
will print the appropriate headers and take the appropriate actions.

If you call C<plan()>, don't call any of the other methods below.

=cut

my %plan_cmds = (
    no_plan     => \&no_plan,
    skip_all    => \&skip_all,
    tests       => \&_plan_tests,

    }

    }

    return;
}

=item B<expected_tests>

    my $max = $Test->expected_tests;
    $Test->expected_tests($max);

Gets/sets the number of tests we expect this test to run and prints out
the appropriate headers.

=cut

sub expected_tests {
    my $self = shift;
    my($max) = @_;

    if(@_) {

Declares that this test will run an indeterminate number of tests.

        no_plan => 1
    );

    return 1;
}


=item B<done_testing>

  $Test->done_testing();
  $Test->done_testing($num_tests);

Declares that you are done testing, no more tests will be run after this point.

If a plan has not yet been output, it will do so.

$num_tests is the number of tests you planned to run.  If a numbered
plan was already declared, and if this contradicts, a failing test
will be run to reflect the planning mistake.  If C<no_plan> was declared,
this will override.

If C<done_testing()> is called twice, the second call will issue a
failing test.

If C<$num_tests> is omitted, the number of tests run will be used, like
no_plan.

C<done_testing()> is, in effect, used when you'd want to use C<no_plan>, but
safer. You'd use it like so:

    $Test->ok($a == $b);
    $Test->done_testing();

Or to plan a variable number of tests:

    for my $test (@tests) {
        $Test->ok($test);
    }
    $Test->done_testing(scalar @tests);

=cut

sub done_testing {
    my($self, $num_tests) = @_;

    $self->croak("Tried to finish testing, but testing is already done")
      if !$self->in_test and $self->history->done_testing;

    if( defined $num_tests ) {
        my $expected_tests = $self->expected_tests;
        if( $expected_tests && $num_tests != $expected_tests ) {
            $self->ok(0, "planned to run $expected_tests but done_testing() expects $num_tests");
        }
        else {
            $self->set_plan( asserts_expected => $num_tests );
        }
    }
    elsif( !$self->history->plan ) {
        $self->test_start unless $self->in_test;
        $self->set_plan( no_plan => 1 );
    }

    $self->test_end;

    return 1;
}


=item B<has_plan>

  $plan = $Test->has_plan

Find out whether a plan has been defined. C<$plan> is either C<undef> (no plan
has been set), C<no_plan> (indeterminate # of tests) or an integer (the number
of expected tests).

=cut

Skips all the tests, using the given C<$reason>.  Exits immediately with 0.

    else {
        exit(0);
    }
}

=item B<exported_to>

  my $pack = $Test->exported_to;
  $Test->exported_to($pack);

Tells Test::Builder what package you exported your functions to.

This method isn't terribly useful since modules which share the same
Test::Builder object might get exported to different packages and only
the last one will be honored.

They all return true if the test passed, false if the test failed.

C<$name> is always optional.

=head2 Test building utility methods

These methods are useful when writing your own test methods.

=over 4

=item B<maybe_regex>

  $Test->maybe_regex(qr/$regex/);
  $Test->maybe_regex('/$regex/');

This method used to be useful back when Test::Builder worked on Perls
before 5.6 which didn't have qr//.  Now it's pretty useless.

Convenience method for building testing functions that take regular
expressions as arguments.

Takes a quoted regular expression produced by C<qr//>, or a string
representing a regular expression.

Returns a Perl value which may be used instead of the corresponding
regular expression, or C<undef> if its argument is not recognised.

For example, a version of C<like()>, sans the useful diagnostic messages,
could be written as:

  sub laconic_like {
      my ($self, $thing, $regex, $name) = @_;
      my $usable_regex = $self->maybe_regex($regex);
      die "expecting regex, found '$regex'\n"

=item B<level>

    $Test->level($how_high);

How far up the call stack should C<$Test> look when reporting where the
test failed.

Defaults to 1.

Setting L<$Test::Builder::Level> overrides.  This is typically useful
localized:

    sub my_ok {
        my $test = shift;

        local $Test::Builder::Level = $Test::Builder::Level + 1;
        $TB->ok($test);

To be polite to other functions wrapping your own you usually want to increment C<$Level> rather than set it to a constant.

    if( defined $level ) {

        $Level = $level;
    }
    return $Level;

=item B<use_numbers>

    $Test->use_numbers($on_or_off);

Whether or not the test should output numbers.  That is, this if true:

  ok 1
  ok 2
  ok 3

or this if false

  ok
  ok
  ok

Most useful when you can't depend on the test output order, such as
when threads or forking is involved.

Defaults to on.

    my( $self, $use_nums ) = @_;

    my $formatter = $self->formatter;
    if( defined $use_nums ) {

=item B<no_diag>

calls to C<diag()> and C<note()>.

    }

    return !$self->formatter->show_logs;
}


=item B<no_ending>

    $Test->no_ending($no_ending);

Normally, Test::Builder does some extra diagnostics when the test
ends.  It also changes the exit code as described below.

If this is true, none of that will be done.

=cut

sub no_ending {
    my $self = shift;

    if( @_ ) {
        my $no = shift;

=item B<no_change_exit_code>

If true, Test::Builder will not change the process' exit code.

See L<test_exit_code> for details.

=head2 Output

Controlling where the test output goes.

It's ok for your test to change where STDOUT and STDERR point to,
Test::Builder's default output settings will not be affected.

=over 4

=item B<diag>

    $Test->diag(@msgs);

Prints out the given C<@msgs>.  Like C<print>, arguments are simply
appended together.

Normally, it uses the C<failure_output()> handle, but if this is for a
TODO test, the C<output()> handle is used.

Output will be indented and marked with a # so as not to interfere
with test output.  A newline will be put on the end if there isn't one
already.

We encourage using this rather than calling print directly.

Returns false.  Why?  Because C<diag()> is often used in conjunction with
a failing test (C<ok() || diag()>) it "passes through" the failure.

    return ok(...) || diag(...);

    my $filehandle = $Test->output;
    $Test->output($filehandle);
    $Test->output($filename);
    $Test->output(\$scalar);

These methods control where Test::Builder will print its output.
They take either an open C<$filehandle>, a C<$filename> to open and write to
or a C<$scalar> reference to append to.  It will always return a C<$filehandle>.

B<output> is where normal "ok/not ok" test output goes.

Defaults to STDOUT.

B<failure_output> is where diagnostic output on test failures and
C<diag()> goes.  It is normally not read by Test::Harness and instead is
displayed to the user.

Defaults to STDERR.

=item B<todo_output>

This method exists for backwards compatibility.

C<todo_output> was used instead of C<failure_output()> for the
diagnostics of a failing TODO test.  These will not be seen by the
user.

Now TODO tests will use C<< $builder->output >> and the TODO
filehandle cannot be set separate from C<output()>.

=item B<summary>

    my @tests = $Test->summary;

A simple summary of the tests so far.  True for pass, false for fail.
This is a logical pass/fail, so todos are passes.

Of course, test #1 is $tests[0], etc...

=cut

sub summary {
    my($self) = shift;

    return map { $_->is_fail ? 0 : 1 } @{$self->history->results};

Returns the name of the current subtest or test.

}

=item B<details>

    my @tests = $Test->details;

Like C<summary()>, but with a lot more detail.

    $tests[$test_num - 1] = 
            { 'ok'       => is the test considered a pass?
              actual_ok  => did it literally say 'ok'?
              name       => name of the test (if any)
              type       => type of test (if any, see below).
              reason     => reason for the above (if any)
            };

'ok' is true if Test::Harness will consider the test to be a pass.

'actual_ok' is a reflection of whether or not the test literally
printed 'ok' or 'not ok'.  This is for examining the result of 'todo'
tests.

'name' is the name of the test.

'type' indicates if it was a special test.  Normal tests have a type
of ''.  Type can be one of the following:

    skip        see skip()
    todo        see todo()
    todo_skip   see todo_skip()
    unknown     see below

Sometimes the Test::Builder test counter is incremented without it
printing any test output, for example, when C<current_test()> is changed.
In these cases, Test::Builder doesn't know the result of the test, so
its type is 'unknown'.  These details for these tests are filled in.
They are considered ok, but the name and actual_ok is left C<undef>.

For example "not ok 23 - hole count # TODO insufficient donuts" would
result in this structure:

    $tests[22] =    # 23 - 1, since arrays start from 0.
      { ok        => 1,   # logically, the test passed since its todo
        actual_ok => 0,   # in absolute terms, it failed
        name      => 'hole count',
        type      => 'todo',
        reason    => 'insufficient donuts'
      };

=item B<todo>

    my $todo_reason = $Test->todo;
    my $todo_reason = $Test->todo($pack);

If the current tests are considered "TODO" it will return the reason,
if any.  This reason can come from a C<$TODO> variable or the last call
to C<todo_start()>.

Since a TODO test does not need a reason, this function can return an
empty string even when inside a TODO block.  Use C<< $Test->in_todo >>
to determine if you are currently inside a TODO block.

C<todo()> is about finding the right package to look for C<$TODO> in.  It's
pretty good at guessing the right package to look at.  It first looks for
the caller based on C<$Level + 1>, since C<todo()> is usually called inside
a test function.  As a last resort it will use C<exported_to()>.

Sometimes there is some confusion about where todo() should be looking
for the C<$TODO> variable.  If you want to be sure, tell it explicitly
what $pack to use.

=cut

sub todo {
    my( $self, $pack ) = @_;

    return $self->{Todo} if defined $self->{Todo};

    local $Level = $Level + 1;
    my $todo = $self->find_TODO($pack);
    return $todo if defined $todo;

    return '';
}

=item B<find_TODO>

    my $todo_reason = $Test->find_TODO();
    my $todo_reason = $Test->find_TODO($pack);

Like C<todo()> but only returns the value of C<$TODO> ignoring
C<todo_start()>.

Can also be used to set C<$TODO> to a new value while returning the
old value:

    my $old_reason = $Test->find_TODO($pack, 1, $new_reason);

=cut

sub find_TODO {
    my( $self, $pack, $set, $new_value ) = @_;

    $pack = $pack || $self->caller(1) || $self->exported_to;
    return unless $pack;

    my $todo = do {
        no strict 'refs';    ## no critic
        no warnings 'once';
        \${ $pack.'::TODO'};
    };
    my $old_value = $$todo;
    $set and $$todo = $new_value;
    return $old_value;
}

=item B<in_todo>

    my $in_todo = $Test->in_todo;

Returns true if the test is currently inside a TODO block.

=cut

sub in_todo {
    my $self = shift;

    local $Level = $Level + 1;
    return( defined $self->{Todo} || $self->find_TODO ) ? 1 : 0;
}

=item B<todo_start>

    $Test->todo_start();
    $Test->todo_start($message);

This method allows you declare all subsequent tests as TODO tests, up until
the C<todo_end> method has been called.

The C<TODO:> and C<$TODO> syntax is generally pretty good about figuring out
whether or not we're in a TODO test.  However, often we find that this is not
possible to determine (such as when we want to use C<$TODO> but
the tests are being executed in other packages which can't be inferred
beforehand).

Note that you can use this to nest "todo" tests

 $Test->todo_start('working on this');
 # lots of code
 $Test->todo_start('working on that');
 # more code
 $Test->todo_end;
 $Test->todo_end;

This is generally not recommended, but large testing systems often have weird
internal needs.

We've tried to make this also work with the TODO: syntax, but it's not
guaranteed and its use is also discouraged:

 TODO: {
     local $TODO = 'We have work to do!';
     $Test->todo_start('working on this');
     # lots of code
     $Test->todo_start('working on that');
     # more code
     $Test->todo_end;
     $Test->todo_end;
 }

Pick one style or another of "TODO" to be on the safe side.

=cut

sub todo_start {
    my $self = shift;
    my $message = @_ ? shift : '';

    $self->{Start_Todo}++;

    }
    $self->{Todo} = $message;

    return;
}

=item C<todo_end>

 $Test->todo_end;

Stops running tests as "TODO" tests.  This method is fatal if called without a
preceding C<todo_start> method call.

=cut

sub todo_end {
    my $self = shift;

    if( !$self->{Start_Todo} ) {

    my $package = $Test->caller;
    my($pack, $file, $line) = $Test->caller;
    my($pack, $file, $line) = $Test->caller($height);

Like the normal C<caller()>, except it reports according to your C<level()>.

C<$height> will be added to the C<level()>.

If C<caller()> winds up off the top of the stack it report the highest context.

a note to contact the author.

  _my_exit($exit_num);

Perl seems to have some trouble with exiting inside an C<END> block.
5.6.1 does some odd things.  Instead, this function edits C<$?>
directly.  It should B<only> be called from inside an C<END> block.
It doesn't actually exit, that's your job.

Determine the exit code of the process to reflect if the test

This does not actually change the exit code.

If L<no_change_exit_code> is set true, the exit code will not be
changed.  $new_exit_code will be identical to the input.

=head1 EXIT CODES

If all your tests passed, Test::Builder will exit with zero (which is
normal).  If anything failed it will exit with how many failed.  If
you run less (or more) tests than you planned, the missing (or extras)
will be considered failures.  If no tests were ever run Test::Builder
will throw a warning and exit with 255.  If the test died, even after
having successfully completed all its tests, it will still be
considered a failure and will exit with 255.

So the exit codes are...

    0                   all tests successful
    255                 test died or all passed but wrong # of tests run
    any other number    how many failed (including missing or extras)

If you fail more than 254 tests, it will be reported as 254.

This behavior can be turned off with L<no_change_exit_code>.

=head1 THREADS

In perl 5.8.1 and later, Test::Builder is thread-safe.  The test
number is shared amongst all threads.  This means if one thread sets
the test number using C<current_test()> they will all be effected.

While versions earlier than 5.8.1 had threads they contain too many
bugs to support.

Test::Builder is only thread-aware if threads.pm is loaded I<before>
Test::Builder.

=head1 MEMORY

An informative hash, accessible via C<<details()>>, is stored for each
test you perform.  So memory usage will scale linearly with each test
run. Although this is not a problem for most test suites, it can
become an issue if you do large (hundred thousands to million)
combinatorics tests in the same run.

In such cases, you are advised to either split the test file into smaller
ones, or use a reverse approach, doing "normal" (code) compares and
triggering fail() should anything go unexpected.

Future versions of Test::Builder will have a way to turn history off.


=head1 EXAMPLES

CPAN can provide the best examples.  Test::Simple, Test::More,
Test::Exception and Test::Differences all use Test::Builder.
