=head1 NAME

Test::Builder - Backend for building test libraries

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In general you probably do not want to use this module directly, but instead
want to use L<Test::Builder::Provider> which will help you roll out a testing
library.

    package My::Test::Module;
    use Test::Builder::Provider;

    # Export a test tool from an anonymous sub
    provide ok => sub {
        my ($test, $name) = @_;
        builder()->ok($test, $name);
    };

    # Export tools that are package subs
    provides qw/is is_deeply/;
    sub is { ... }
    sub is_deeply { ... }

See L<Test::Builder::Provider> for more details.

B<Note:> You MUST use 'provide', or 'provides' to export testing tools, this
allows you to use the C<< builder()->trace_test >> tools to determine what
file/line a failed test came from.

=head2 LOW-LEVEL

    use Test::Builder;
    my $tb = Test::Builder->create(modern => 1, shared_stream => 1);
    $tb->ok(1);
    ....

=head2 DEPRECATED

    use Test::Builder;
    my $tb = Test::Builder->new;
    $tb->ok(1);
    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Test::Simple> and L<Test::More> have proven to be popular testing modules,
but they're not always flexible enough.  Test::Builder provides a
building block upon which to write your own test libraries I<which can
work together>.

=head1 TEST COMPONENT MAP

  [Test Script] > [Test Tool] > [Test::Builder] > [Test::Bulder::Stream] > [Result Formatter]
                                      ^
                                 You are here

A test script uses a test tool such as L<Test::More>, which uses Test::Builder
to produce results. The results are sent to L<Test::Builder::Stream> which then
forwards them on to one or more formatters. The default formatter is
L<Test::Builder::Fromatter::TAP> which produces TAP output.

=item $Test = Test::Builder->create(%params)

Create a completely independant Test::Builder object.

    my $Test = Test::Builder->create;

Create a Test::Builder object that sends results to the shared output stream
(usually what you want).

    my $Test = Test::Builder->create(shared_stream => 1);

Create a Test::Builder object that does not include any legacy cruft.

    my $Test = Test::Builder->create(modern => 1);

B<NOTE>: C<$Level> is tied to the package, not the instance. Basically this
means you should avoid using $Level in favor of the trace_test method. $Level
still exists purely for legacy support.

=item $Test = Test::Builder->new B<***DEPRECATED***>

    my $Test = Test::Builder->new;

B<This usage is DEPRECATED!>

Returns the Test::Builder singleton object representing the current state of
the test.

Since you only run one test per program C<new> always returns the same
Test::Builder object.  No matter how many times you call C<new()>, you're
getting the same object.  This is called a singleton.  This is done so that
multiple modules share such global information as the test counter and
where test output is going. B<No longer necessary>

If you want a completely new Test::Builder object different from the
singleton, use C<create>.

=head2 SIMPLE ACCESSORS AND SHORTCUTS

=head3 READ/WRITE ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item $parent = $Test->parent

Returns the parent C<Test::Builder> instance, if any.  Only used with child
builders for nested TAP.

=item $Test->name

Defaults to $0, but subtests and child tests will set this.

=item $Test->modern

Defaults to $ENV{TB_MODERN}, or 0. True when the builder object was constructed
with modern practices instead of deprecated ones.

=item $Test->depth

Get/Set the depth. This is usually set for Child tests.

=back

=head3 DELEGATES TO STREAM

Each of these is a shortcut to C<< $Test->stream->NAME >>

See the L<Test::Builder::Stream> documentation for details.

=over 4

=item $Test->is_passing(...)

=item $Test->listen(...)

=item $Test->munge(...)

=item $Test->tap

=item $Test->lresults

=item $Test->use_fork

=item $Test->no_fork

=back

=head2 CHILDREN AND SUBTESTS

=over 4

=item $Test->subtest($name, \&subtests, @args)

See documentation of C<subtest> in Test::More.

C<subtest> also, and optionally, accepts arguments which will be passed to the
subtests reference.

=item $child = $Test->child($name)

  my $child = $builder->child($name_of_child);
  $child->plan( tests => 4 );
  $child->ok(some_code());
  ...
  $child->finalize;

Returns a new instance of C<Test::Builder>.  Any output from this child will
be indented four spaces more than the parent's indentation.  When done, the
C<finalize> method I<must> be called explicitly.

Trying to create a new child with a previous child still active (i.e.,
C<finalize> not called) will C<croak>.

Trying to run a test when you have an open child will also C<croak> and cause
the test suite to fail.

=item $ok = $Child->finalize

When your child is done running tests, you must call C<finalize> to clean up
and tell the parent your pass/fail status.

Calling C<finalize> on a child with open children will C<croak>.

If the child falls out of scope before C<finalize> is called, a failure
diagnostic will be issued and the child is considered to have failed.

No attempt to call methods on a child after C<finalize> is called is
guaranteed to succeed.

Calling this on the root builder is a no-op.

=back

=head2 STREAM MANAGEMENT

=over 4

=item $stream = $Test->stream

=item $Test->stream($stream)

=item $Test->stream(undef)

Get/Set the stream. When no stream is set, or is undef it will return the
shared stream.

B<Note:> Do not set this to the shared stream yourself, set it to undef. This
is because the shared stream is actually a stack, and this always returns the
top of the stack.

=item $results = $Test->intercept(\&code)

Any tests run inside the codeblock will be intercepted and not sent to the
normal stream. Instead they will be added to C<$results> which is an array of
L<Test::Builder::Result> objects.

B<Note:> This will also intercept BAIL_OUT and skipall.

B<Note:> This will only intercept results generated with the Test::Builder
object on which C<intercept()> was called. Other builders will still send to
the normal places.

See L<Test::Tester2> for a method of capturing results sent to the global
stream.

=back

=head2 TRACING THE TEST/PROVIDER BOUNDRY

When a test fails it will report the filename and line where the failure
occured. In order to do this it needs to look at the stack and figure out where
your tests stop, and the tools you are using begin. These methods help you find
the desired caller frame.

See the L<Test::Builder::Trace> module for more details.

=over 4

=item $trace = $Test->trace_test()

Returns an L<Test::Builder::Trace> object.

=item $reason = $Test->find_TODO

=item $reason = $Test->find_TODO($pack)

=item $old_reason = $Test->find_TODO($pack, 1, $new_reason);

Like C<todo()> but only returns the value of C<$TODO> ignoring
C<todo_start()>.

Can also be used to set C<$TODO> to a new value while returning the
old value.

=back

=head2 TEST PLAN

=over 4

=item $Test->plan('no_plan');

=item $Test->plan( skip_all => $reason );

=item $Test->plan( tests => $num_tests );

A convenient way to set up your tests.  Call this and Test::Builder
will print the appropriate headers and take the appropriate actions.

If you call C<plan()>, don't call any of the other methods below.

If a child calls "skip_all" in the plan, a C<Test::Builder::Exception> is
thrown.  Trap this error, call C<finalize()> and don't run any more tests on
the child.

    my $child = $Test->child('some child');
    eval { $child->plan( $condition ? ( skip_all => $reason ) : ( tests => 3 )  ) };
    if ( eval { $@->isa('Test::Builder::Exception') } ) {
       $child->finalize;
       return;
    }
    # run your tests

=item $Test->no_plan;

Declares that this test will run an indeterminate number of tests.

=item $Test->skip_all

=item $Test->skip_all($reason)

Skips all the tests, using the given C<$reason>.  Exits immediately with 0.

=item $Test->done_testing

=item $Test->done_testing($count)

Declares that you are done testing, no more tests will be run after this point.

If a plan has not yet been output, it will do so.

$num_tests is the number of tests you planned to run.  If a numbered
plan was already declared, and if this contradicts, a failing result
will be run to reflect the planning mistake.  If C<no_plan> was declared,
this will override.

If C<done_testing()> is called twice, the second call will issue a
failing result.

If C<$num_tests> is omitted, the number of tests run will be used, like
no_plan.

C<done_testing()> is, in effect, used when you'd want to use C<no_plan>, but
safer. You'd use it like so:

    $Test->ok($a == $b);
    $Test->done_testing();

Or to plan a variable number of tests:

    for my $test (@tests) {
        $Test->ok($test);
    }
    $Test->done_testing(scalar @tests);

=back

=head2 SIMPLE RESULT PRODUCERS

Each of these produces 1 or more L<Test::Builder::Result> objects which are fed
into the result stream.

=over 4

=item $Test->ok($test)

=item $Test->ok($test, $name)

Your basic test.  Pass if C<$test> is true, fail if $test is false.  Just
like L<Test::Simple>'s C<ok()>.

=item $Test->BAIL_OUT($reason);

Indicates to the L<Test::Harness> that things are going so badly all
testing should terminate.  This includes running any additional test
scripts.

It will exit with 255.

=item $Test->skip

=item $Test->skip($why)

Skips the current test, reporting C<$why>.

=item $Test->todo_skip

=item $Test->todo_skip($why)

Like C<skip()>, only it will declare the test as failing and TODO.  Similar
to

    print "not ok $tnum # TODO $why\n";

=item $Test->diag(@msgs)

Prints out the given C<@msgs>.  Like C<print>, arguments are simply
appended together.

Normally, it uses the C<failure_output()> handle, but if this is for a
TODO test, the C<todo_output()> handle is used.

Output will be indented and marked with a # so as not to interfere
with test output.  A newline will be put on the end if there isn't one
already.

We encourage using this rather than calling print directly.

Returns false.  Why?  Because C<diag()> is often used in conjunction with
a failing test (C<ok() || diag()>) it "passes through" the failure.

    return ok(...) || diag(...);

=item $Test->note(@msgs)

Like C<diag()>, but it prints to the C<output()> handle so it will not
normally be seen by the user except in verbose mode.

=back

=head2 ADVANCED RESULT PRODUCERS

=over 4

=item $Test->is_eq($got, $expected, $name)

Like Test::More's C<is()>.  Checks if C<$got eq $expected>.  This is the
string version.

C<undef> only ever matches another C<undef>.

=item $Test->is_num($got, $expected, $name)

Like Test::More's C<is()>.  Checks if C<$got == $expected>.  This is the
numeric version.

C<undef> only ever matches another C<undef>.

=item $Test->isnt_eq($got, $dont_expect, $name)

Like L<Test::More>'s C<isnt()>.  Checks if C<$got ne $dont_expect>.  This is
the string version.

=item $Test->isnt_num($got, $dont_expect, $name)

Like L<Test::More>'s C<isnt()>.  Checks if C<$got ne $dont_expect>.  This is
the numeric version.

=item $Test->like($thing, qr/$regex/, $name)

=item $Test->like($thing, '/$regex/', $name)

Like L<Test::More>'s C<like()>.  Checks if $thing matches the given C<$regex>.

=item $Test->unlike($thing, qr/$regex/, $name)

=item $Test->unlike($thing, '/$regex/', $name)

Like L<Test::More>'s C<unlike()>.  Checks if $thing $Test->does not match the
given C<$regex>.

=item $Test->cmp_ok($thing, $type, $that, $name)

Works just like L<Test::More>'s C<cmp_ok()>.

    $Test->cmp_ok($big_num, '!=', $other_big_num);

=back

=head2 PUBLIC HELPERS

=over 4

=item @dump = $Test->explain(@msgs)

Will dump the contents of any references in a human readable format.
Handy for things like...

    is_deeply($have, $want) || diag explain $have;

or

    is_deeply($have, $want) || note explain $have;

=item $tb->carp(@message)

Warns with C<@message> but the message will appear to come from the
point where the original test function was called (C<< $tb->caller >>).

=item $tb->croak(@message)

Dies with C<@message> but the message will appear to come from the
point where the original test function was called (C<< $tb->caller >>).

=item $plan = $Test->has_plan

Find out whether a plan has been defined. C<$plan> is either C<undef> (no plan
has been set), C<no_plan> (indeterminate # of tests) or an integer (the number
of expected tests).

=item $Test->reset

Reinitializes the Test::Builder singleton to its original state.
Mostly useful for tests run in persistent environments where the same
test might be run multiple times in the same process.

=item %context = $Test->context

Returns a hash of contextual info.

    (
        depth  => DEPTH,
        source => NAME,
        trace  => TRACE,
    )

=back

=head2 TODO MANAGEMENT

=over 4

=item $todo_reason = $Test->todo

=item $todo_reason = $Test->todo($pack)

If the current tests are considered "TODO" it will return the reason,
if any.  This reason can come from a C<$TODO> variable or the last call
to C<todo_start()>.

Since a TODO test does not need a reason, this function can return an
empty string even when inside a TODO block.  Use C<< $Test->in_todo >>
to determine if you are currently inside a TODO block.

C<todo()> is about finding the right package to look for C<$TODO> in.  It's
pretty good at guessing the right package to look at.  It first looks for
the caller based on C<$Level + 1>, since C<todo()> is usually called inside
a test function.  As a last resort it will use C<exported_to()>.

Sometimes there is some confusion about where C<todo()> should be looking
for the C<$TODO> variable.  If you want to be sure, tell it explicitly
what $pack to use.

=item $in_todo = $Test->in_todo

Returns true if the test is currently inside a TODO block.

=item $Test->todo_start()

=item $Test->todo_start($message)

This method allows you declare all subsequent tests as TODO tests, up until
the C<todo_end> method has been called.

The C<TODO:> and C<$TODO> syntax is generally pretty good about figuring out
whether or not we're in a TODO test.  However, often we find that this is not
possible to determine (such as when we want to use C<$TODO> but
the tests are being executed in other packages which can't be inferred
beforehand).

Note that you can use this to nest "todo" tests

 $Test->todo_start('working on this');
 # lots of code
 $Test->todo_start('working on that');
 # more code
 $Test->todo_end;
 $Test->todo_end;

This is generally not recommended, but large testing systems often have weird
internal needs.

We've tried to make this also work with the TODO: syntax, but it's not
guaranteed and its use is also discouraged:

 TODO: {
     local $TODO = 'We have work to do!';
     $Test->todo_start('working on this');
     # lots of code
     $Test->todo_start('working on that');
     # more code
     $Test->todo_end;
     $Test->todo_end;
 }

Pick one style or another of "TODO" to be on the safe side.

=item $Test->todo_end

Stops running tests as "TODO" tests.  This method is fatal if called without a
preceding C<todo_start> method call.

=back

=head2 DEPRECATED/LEGACY

All of these will issue warnings if called on a modern Test::Builder object.
That is any Test::Builder instance that was created with the 'modern' flag.

=over

=item $self->no_ending

B<Deprecated:> Moved to the L<Test::Builder::Stream> object.

    $Test->no_ending($no_ending);

Normally, Test::Builder does some extra diagnostics when the test
ends.  It also changes the exit code as described below.

If this is true, none of that will be done.

=item $self->summary

B<Deprecated:> Moved to the L<Test::Builder::Stream> object.

The style of result recording used here is deprecated. The functionality was
moved to its own object to contain the legacy code.

    my @tests = $Test->summary;

A simple summary of the tests so far.  True for pass, false for fail.
This is a logical pass/fail, so todos are passes.

Of course, test #1 is $tests[0], etc...

=item $self->details

B<Deprecated:> Moved to the L<Test::Builder::Formatter::LegacyResults> object.

The style of result recording used here is deprecated. The functionality was
moved to its own object to contain the legacy code.

    my @tests = $Test->details;

Like C<summary()>, but with a lot more detail.

    $tests[$test_num - 1] =
            { 'ok'       => is the test considered a pass?
              actual_ok  => did it literally say 'ok'?
              name       => name of the test (if any)
              type       => type of test (if any, see below).
              reason     => reason for the above (if any)
            };

'ok' is true if Test::Harness will consider the test to be a pass.

'actual_ok' is a reflection of whether or not the test literally
printed 'ok' or 'not ok'.  This is for examining the result of 'todo'
tests.

'name' is the name of the test.

'type' indicates if it was a special test.  Normal tests have a type
of ''.  Type can be one of the following:

    skip        see skip()
    todo        see todo()
    todo_skip   see todo_skip()
    unknown     see below

Sometimes the Test::Builder test counter is incremented without it
printing any test output, for example, when C<current_test()> is changed.
In these cases, Test::Builder doesn't know the result of the test, so
its type is 'unknown'.  These details for these tests are filled in.
They are considered ok, but the name and actual_ok is left C<undef>.

For example "not ok 23 - hole count # TODO insufficient donuts" would
result in this structure:

    $tests[22] =    # 23 - 1, since arrays start from 0.
      { ok        => 1,   # logically, the test passed since its todo
        actual_ok => 0,   # in absolute terms, it failed
        name      => 'hole count',
        type      => 'todo',
        reason    => 'insufficient donuts'
      };

=item $self->no_header

B<Deprecated:> moved to the L<Test::Builder::Formatter::TAP> object.

    $Test->no_header($no_header);

If set to true, no "1..N" header will be printed.

=item $self->no_diag

B<Deprecated:> moved to the L<Test::Builder::Formatter::TAP> object.

If set true no diagnostics will be printed.  This includes calls to
C<diag()>.

=item $self->output

=item $self->failure_output

=item $self->todo_output

B<Deprecated:> moved to the L<Test::Builder::Formatter::TAP> object.

    my $filehandle = $Test->output;
    $Test->output($filehandle);
    $Test->output($filename);
    $Test->output(\$scalar);

These methods control where Test::Builder will print its output.
They take either an open C<$filehandle>, a C<$filename> to open and write to
or a C<$scalar> reference to append to.  It will always return a C<$filehandle>.

B<output> is where normal "ok/not ok" test output goes.

Defaults to STDOUT.

B<failure_output> is where diagnostic output on test failures and
C<diag()> goes.  It is normally not read by Test::Harness and instead is
displayed to the user.

Defaults to STDERR.

C<todo_output> is used instead of C<failure_output()> for the
diagnostics of a failing TODO test.  These will not be seen by the
user.

Defaults to STDOUT.

=item $self->reset_outputs

B<Deprecated:> moved to the L<Test::Builder::Formatter::TAP> object.

    $tb->reset_outputs;

Resets all the output filehandles back to their defaults.

=item $self->use_numbers

B<Deprecated:> moved to the L<Test::Builder::Formatter::TAP> object.

    $Test->use_numbers($on_or_off);

Whether or not the test should output numbers.  That is, this if true:

  ok 1
  ok 2
  ok 3

or this if false

  ok
  ok
  ok

Most useful when you can't depend on the test output order, such as
when threads or forking is involved.

Defaults to on.

=item $pack = $Test->exported_to

=item $Test->exported_to($pack)

B<Deprecated:> Use C<< Test::Builder::Trace->anoint($package) >> and
C<< $Test->trace_anointed >> instead.

Tells Test::Builder what package you exported your functions to.

This method isn't terribly useful since modules which share the same
Test::Builder object might get exported to different packages and only
the last one will be honored.

=item $is_fh = $Test->is_fh($thing);

Determines if the given C<$thing> can be used as a filehandle.

=item $curr_test = $Test->current_test;

=item $Test->current_test($num);

Gets/sets the current test number we're on.  You usually shouldn't
have to set this.

If set forward, the details of the missing tests are filled in as 'unknown'.
if set backward, the details of the intervening tests are deleted.  You
can erase history if you really want to.

=item $Test->BAIL_OUT($reason);

Indicates to the L<Test::Harness> that things are going so badly all
testing should terminate.  This includes running any additional test
scripts.

It will exit with 255.

=item $max = $Test->expected_tests

=item $Test->expected_tests($max)

Gets/sets the number of tests we expect this test to run and prints out
the appropriate headers.

=item $package = $Test->caller

=item ($pack, $file, $line) = $Test->caller

=item ($pack, $file, $line) = $Test->caller($height)

Like the normal C<caller()>, except it reports according to your C<level()>.

C<$height> will be added to the C<level()>.

If C<caller()> winds up off the top of the stack it report the highest context.

=item $Test->level($how_high)

How far up the call stack should C<$Test> look when reporting where the
test failed.

Defaults to 1.

Setting L<$Test::Builder::Level> overrides.  This is typically useful
localized:

    sub my_ok {
        my $test = shift;

        local $Test::Builder::Level = $Test::Builder::Level + 1;
        $TB->ok($test);
    }

To be polite to other functions wrapping your own you usually want to increment C<$Level> rather than set it to a constant.

=item $Test->maybe_regex(qr/$regex/)

=item $Test->maybe_regex('/$regex/')

This method used to be useful back when Test::Builder worked on Perls
before 5.6 which didn't have qr//.  Now its pretty useless.

Convenience method for building testing functions that take regular
expressions as arguments.

Takes a quoted regular expression produced by C<qr//>, or a string
representing a regular expression.

Returns a Perl value which may be used instead of the corresponding
regular expression, or C<undef> if its argument is not recognised.

For example, a version of C<like()>, sans the useful diagnostic messages,
could be written as:

  sub laconic_like {
      my ($self, $thing, $regex, $name) = @_;
      my $usable_regex = $self->maybe_regex($regex);
      die "expecting regex, found '$regex'\n"
          unless $usable_regex;
      $self->ok($thing =~ m/$usable_regex/, $name);
  }

=back

=head1 EXIT CODES

If all your tests passed, Test::Builder will exit with zero (which is
normal).  If anything failed it will exit with how many failed.  If
you run less (or more) tests than you planned, the missing (or extras)
will be considered failures.  If no tests were ever run Test::Builder
will throw a warning and exit with 255.  If the test died, even after
having successfully completed all its tests, it will still be
considered a failure and will exit with 255.

So the exit codes are...

    0                   all tests successful
    255                 test died or all passed but wrong # of tests run
    any other number    how many failed (including missing or extras)

If you fail more than 254 tests, it will be reported as 254.

B<Note:> The magic that accomplishes this has been moved to
L<Test::Builder::ExitMagic>

=head1 THREADS

In perl 5.8.1 and later, Test::Builder is thread-safe.  The test
number is shared amongst all threads.

While versions earlier than 5.8.1 had threads they contain too many
bugs to support.

Test::Builder is only thread-aware if threads.pm is loaded I<before>
Test::Builder.

=head1 MEMORY

An informative hash, accessible via C<details()>, is stored for each
test you perform.  So memory usage will scale linearly with each test
run. Although this is not a problem for most test suites, it can
become an issue if you do large (hundred thousands to million)
combinatorics tests in the same run.

In such cases, you are advised to either split the test file into smaller
ones, or use a reverse approach, doing "normal" (code) compares and
triggering C<fail()> should anything go unexpected.

You can turn this off:

    $Test->stream->no_lresults;

The shared stream has it on by default.

=head1 EXAMPLES

CPAN can provide the best examples.  L<Test::Simple>, L<Test::More>,
L<Test::Exception> and L<Test::Differences> all use Test::Builder.
