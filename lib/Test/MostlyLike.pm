mostly_like() takes two or three args, you gave %d.
This usually means you passed an array or hash instead
of a reference to it

=head1 NAME

Test::MostlyLike - Relaxed checking of deep data structures.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $got = [qw/foo bar baz/];

    mostly_like(
        $got,
        ['foo', qr/a/],
        "Deeply nested structure matches (mostly)"
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A tool based on C<is_deeply> from L<Test::More>. This tool produces nearly
identical diagnostics. This tool gives you extra control by letting you check
only the parts of the structure you care about, ignoring the rest.

=head1 EXPORTS

=over 4

=item $bool = mostly_like($got, $expect, $name)

Generates a single ok event with diagnostics to help you find any failures.

Got should be the data structure you want to test. $expect should be a data
structure representing what you expect to see. Unlike C<is_deeply> any keys in
C<$got> that do not I<exist> in C<$expect> will be ignored.

=back

=head1 WHAT TO EXPECT

When an a blessed object is encountered in the C<$got> structure, any fields
listed in C<$expect> will be called as methods on the C<$got> object. See the
object/direct element access section below for bypassing this.

Any keys or attributes in C<$got> will be ignored unless the also I<exist> in C<$expect>

=head1 IGNORING THINGS YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT

    my $got    = { foo => 1, bar => 2 };
    my $expect = { foo => 1 };

    mostly_like($got, $expect, "Ignores 'bar'");

If you want to check that a value is not set:

    my $got    = { foo => 1, bar => 2 };
    my $expect = { foo => 1, bar => undef };

    mostly_like($got, $expect, "Will fail since 'bar' has a value");

=head2 EXACT MATCHES

    my $got    = 'foo';
    my $expect = 'foo';
    mostly_like($got, $expect, "Check a value directly");

Also works for deeply nested structures

    mostly_like(
        [
            {stuff => 'foo bar baz'},
        ],
        [
            {stuff => 'foo bar baz'},
        ],
        "Check a value directly, nested"
    );

=head2 REGEX MATCHES

    my $got    = 'foo bar baz';
    my $expect = qr/bar/;
    mostly_like($got, $expect, 'Match');

Works nested as well:

    mostly_like(
        [
            {stuff => 'foo bar baz'},
        ],
        [
            {stuff => qr/bar/},
        ],
        "Check a value directly, nested"
    );

=head2 ARRAY ELEMENT MATCHES

    my $got = [qw/foo bar baz/];
    my $exp = [qw/foo bar/];

    mostly_like($got, $exp, "Ignores unspecified indexes");

You can also just check specific indexes:

    my $got = [qw/foo bar baz/];
    my $exp = { ':1' => 'bar' };

    mostly_like($got, $exp, "Only checks array index 1");

When doing this the index must always be prefixed with ':'.

=head2 HASH ELEMENT MATCHES

    my $got = { foo => 1, bar => 2 };
    my $exp = { foo => 1 };

    mostly_like($got, $exp, "Only checks foo");

=head2 OBJECT METHOD MATCHES

=head3 UNALTERED

    sub foo { $_[0]->{foo} }

    my $got = bless {foo => 1}, __PACKAGE__;
    my $exp = { foo => 1 };

    mostly_like($got, $exp, 'Checks the return of $got->foo()');

=head3 WRAPPED

Sometimes methods return lists, in such cases you can wrap them in arrayrefs or
hashrefs:

    sub list { qw/foo bar baz/ }
    sub dict { foo => 0, bar => 1, baz => 2 }

    my $got = bless {}, __PACKAGE__;
    my $exp = {
        '[list]' => [ qw/foo bar baz/ ],
        '[dict]' => { foo => 0, bar => 1, baz => 2 },
    };
    mostly_like($got, $exp, "Wrapped the method calls");

=head3 DIRECT ELEMENT ACCESS

Sometimes you want to ignore the methods and get the hash value directly.

    sub foo { die "do not call me" }

    my $got = bless { foo => 'secret' }, __PACKAGE__;
    my $exp = { ':foo' => 'secret' };

    mostly_like($got, $exp, "Did not call the fatal method");
