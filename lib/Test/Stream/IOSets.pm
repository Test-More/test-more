=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::IOSets - Manage sets of IO Handles in specific encodings.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The module does 2 things, first it emulates the old behavior of
L<Test::Builder> which clones and modifies the STDOUT and STDERR handles. This
legacy behavior can be referenced as C<'legacy'> in place of an encoding. It
also manages multiple clones of the standard file handles which are set to
specific encodings.

=head1 METHODS

In general you should not use this module yourself. If you must use it directly
then there is really only 1 method you should use:

=over 4

=item $ar = $ioset->init_encoding($ENCODING)

=item $ar = $ioset->init_encoding('legacy')

=item $ar = $ioset->init_encoding($NAME, $STDOUT, $STDERR)

C<init_encoding()> will return an arrayref of 3 filehandles, STDOUT, STDERR,
and TODO. TODO is typically just STDOUT again. If the encoding specified has
not yet been initialized it will initialize it. If you provide filehandles they
will be used, but only during initializatin. Typically a filehandle set is
created by cloning STDER and STDOUT and modifying them to use the correct
encoding.

=back

=head1 CONSTANTS

These can all be imported, but none are exported by default.

=over 4

=item OUT_STD

=item OUT_ERR

=item OUT_TODO

These are indexes of specific IO handles inside an IO set (each encoding has an
IO set).
