=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::Event - Base class for events

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Base class for all event objects that get passed through
L<Test::Stream>.

=head1 SYNOPSYS

    package Test::Stream::Event::MyEvent;
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    # This will make our class an event subclass, add the specified accessors,
    # add constants for all our fields, and fields we inherit.
    use Test::Stream::Event(
        accessors  => [qw/foo bar baz/],
    );

    # Chance to initialize some defaults
    sub init {
        my $self = shift;
        # no other args in @_

        $self->SUPER::init();

        $self->set_foo('xxx') unless defined $self->foo;

        # Events are arrayrefs, all accessors have a constant defined with
        # their index.
        $self->[BAR] ||= "";

        ...
    }

    # If your event produces TAP output it must define this method
    sub to_tap {
        my $self = shift;
        return (
            # Constants are defined at import, all are optional, and may appear
            # any number of times.
            [OUT_STD, $self->foo],
            [OUT_ERR, $self->bar],
            [OUT_STD, $self->baz],
        );
    }

    # This is your hook to add details to the summary fields.
    sub extra_details {
        my $self = shift;

        my @super_details = $self->SUPER::extra_details();

        return (
            @super_details,

            foo => $self->foo || undef,
            bar => $self->bar || '',
            ...
        );
    }

    1;

And to use it:

    my $ctx = context();
    $ctx->send_event('MyEvent', foo => 1, baz => 2);

=head1 IMPORTING

=head2 ARGUMENTS

In addition to the arguments listed here, you may pass in any arguments
accepted by L<Test::Stream::HashBase>.

=over 4

=item base => $BASE_CLASS

This lets you specify an event class to subclass. B<THIS MUST BE AN EVENT
CLASS>. If you do not specify anything here then C<Test::Stream::Event> will be
used.

=item accessors => \@FIELDS

This lets you define any fields you wish to be present in your class. This is
the only way to define storage for your event. Each field specified will get a
read-only accessor with the same name as the field, as well as a setter
C<set_FIELD()>. You will also get a constant that returns the index of the
field in the classes arrayref. The constant is the name of the field in all
upper-case.

=back

=head2 SUBCLASSING

C<Test::Stream::Event> is added to your @INC for you, unless you specify an
alternative base class, which must itself subclass C<Test::Stream::Event>.

Events B<CAN NOT> use multiple inheritance in most cases. This is mainly
because events are arrayrefs and not hashrefs. Each subclass must add fields as
new indexes after the last index of the parent class.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $ctx = $e->context

Get a snapshot of the context as it was when this event was generated

=item $call = $e->created

Get the C<caller()> details from when the objects was created. This is usually
the call to the tool that generated the event such as C<Test::More::ok()>.

=item $bool = $e->in_subtest

Check if the event was generated within a subtest.

=item $encoding = $e->encoding

Get the encoding that was in effect when the event was generated

=item @details = $e->extra_details

Get an ordered key/value pair list of summary fields for the event. Override
this to add additional fields.

=item @summary = $e->summary

Get an ordered key/value pair list of summary fields for the event, including
parent class fields. In general you should not override this as it has a useful
(thought not depended upon) order.

=back

=head1 SUMMARY FIELDS

These are the fields that will be present when calling
C<< my %sum = $e->summary >>. Please note that the fields are returned as an
order key+pair list, they can be directly assigned to a hash if desired, or
they can be assigned to an array to preserver the order. The order is as it
appears below, B<NOT> alphabetical.

=over 4

=item type

The name of the event type, typically this is the lowercase form of the last
part of the class name.

=item package

The package that generated this event.

=item file

The file in which the event was generated, and to which errors should be attributed.

=item line

The line number on which the event was generated, and to which errors should be
attributed.

=item tool_package

The package that provided the tool that generated the event (example:
Test::More)

=item tool_name

The name of the sub that produced the event (examples: C<ok()>, C<is()>).

=item encoding

The encoding that should be used when printing the TAP output from this event.

=item in_todo

True if the event was generated while TODO was in effect.

=item todo

The todo message if the event was generated with TODO in effect.

=item pid

The PID in which the event was generated.

=item skip

The skip message if the event was generated via skip.
