=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::HashBase::Meta - Meta Object for HashBase objects.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<Note:> You probably do not want to directly use this object.

    my $meta = Test::Stream::HashBase::Meta->new('Some::Class');
    $meta->add_accessor('foo');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the meta-object used by L<Test::Stream::HashBase>

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $meta = $class->new($package)

Create a new meta object for the specified class. If one already exists that
instance is returned.

=item $meta = $class->get($package)

Get the meta object for the specified class. Returns C<undef> if there is none
initiated.

=item $package = $meta->package

Get the package the meta-object manages.

=item $package = $meta->parent

Get the parent package to the one being managed.

=item $bool = $meta->locked

True if the package has been locked. Locked means no new accessors can be
added. A package is locked once something else subclasses it.

=item $hr = $meta->fields

Get a hashref defining the fields on the package. This is primarily for
internal use, it is not very useful outside.

=item $ar = $meta->order

All fields for the class in order starting with fields from base classes.

=item $meta->baseclass

Make the package inherit from HashBase directly.

=item $meta->subclass($package)

Set C<$package> as the base class of the managed package.

=item $meta->add_accessor($name)

Add an accessor to the package. Also defines the C<"set_$name"> method, and the
C<uc($name)> constant.
