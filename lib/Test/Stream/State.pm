=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::State - Representation of the state of the testing

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL CODE WARNING

B<This is an experimental release!> Test-Stream, and all its components are
still in an experimental phase. This dist has been released to cpan in order to
allow testers and early adopters the chance to write experimental new tools
with it, or to add experimental support for it into old tools.

B<PLEASE DO NOT COMPLETELY CONVERT OLD TOOLS YET>. This experimental release is
very likely to see a lot of code churn. API's may break at any time.
Test-Stream should NOT be depended on by any toolchain level tools until the
experimental phase is over.

=head2 BACKWARDS COMPATABILITY SHIM

By default, loading Test-Stream will block Test::Builder and related namespaces
from loading at all. You can work around this by loading the compatability shim
which will populate the Test::Builder and related namespaces with a
compatability implementation on demand.

    use Test::Stream::Shim;
    use Test::Builder;
    use Test::More;

B<Note:> Modules that are experimenting with Test::Stream should NOT load the
shim in their module files. The shim should only ever be loaded in a test file.
