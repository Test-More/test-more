=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::PackageUtil - Utils for manipulating package symbol tables.

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL CODE WARNING

B<This is an experimental release!> Test-Stream, and all its components are
still in an experimental phase. This dist has been released to cpan in order to
allow testers and early adopters the chance to write experimental new tools
with it, or to add experimental support for it into old tools.

B<PLEASE DO NOT COMPLETELY CONVERT OLD TOOLS YET>. This experimental release is
very likely to see a lot of code churn. API's may break at any time.
Test-Stream should NOT be depended on by any toolchain level tools until the
experimental phase is over.

=head2 BACKWARDS COMPATABILITY SHIM

By default, loading Test-Stream will block Test::Builder and related namespaces
from loading at all. You can work around this by loading the compatability shim
which will populate the Test::Builder and related namespaces with a
compatability implementation on demand.

    use Test::Stream::Shim;
    use Test::Builder;
    use Test::More;

B<Note:> Modules that are experimenting with Test::Stream should NOT load the
shim in their module files. The shim should only ever be loaded in a test file.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Collection of utilities L<Test::Stream> and friends use to manipulate package
symbol tables. This is primarily useful when trackign things like C<$TODO>
vars. It is also used for exporting and meta-construction of object methods.

=head1 EXPORTS

Both exports are exported by default, you cannot pick and choose. These work
equally well as functions and class-methods. These will not work as object
methods.

=over 4

=item $ref = package_sym($PACKAGE, $SLOT => $NAME)

Get the reference to a symbol in the package. C<$PACKAGE> should be the package
name. C<$SLOT> should be a valid typeglob slot (Supported slots: HASH SCALAR ARRAY
IO FORMAT CODE). C<$NAME> should be the name of the symbol.

=item package_purge_sym($PACKAGE, $SLOT => $NAME, $SLOT2 => $NAME2, ...)

This is used to remove symbols from a package. The first argument, C<$PACKAGE>,
should be the name of the package. The remaining arguments should be key/value
pairs. The key in each pair should be the typeglob slot to clear (Supported
slots: HASH SCALAR ARRAY IO FORMAT CODE). The value in the pair should be the
name of the symbol to remove.
