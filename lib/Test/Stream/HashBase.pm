=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::HashBase - Base class for classes that use a hashref
of a hash.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

A class:

    package My::Class;
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use Test::Stream::HashBase accessors => [qw/foo bar baz/];

    # Chance to initialize defaults
    sub init {
        my $self = shift;    # No other args
        $self->{+FOO} ||= "foo";
        $self->{+BAR} ||= "bar";
        $self->{+BAZ} ||= "baz";
    }

    sub print {
        print join ", " => map { $self->{$_} } FOO, BAR, BAZ;
    }

Subclass it

    package My::Subclass;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Test::Stream::HashBase base => 'My::Class',    # subclass
        accessors                   => ['bat'];

    sub init {
        my $self = shift;

        # We get the constants from the base class for free.
        $self->{+FOO} ||= 'SubFoo';
        $self->{+BAT} || = 'bat';

        $self->SUPER::init();
    }

use it:

    package main;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use My::Class;

    my $one = My::Class->new(foo => 'MyFoo', bar => 'MyBar');

    # Accessors!
    my $foo = $one->foo;    # 'MyFoo'
    my $bar = $one->bar;    # 'MyBar'
    my $baz = $one->baz;    # Defaulted to: 'baz'

    # Setters!
    $one->set_foo('A Foo');
    $one->set_bar('A Bar');
    $one->set_baz('A Baz');

    # import constants:
    use My::Class qw/FOO BAR BAZ/;

    $one->{+FOO} = 'xxx';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package is used to generate classes based on hashrefs instead of
arrayrefs.  Using this class will give you a C<new()> method, as well as
generating accessors you request.  Generated accessors will be getters,
C<set_ACCESSOR> setters will also be generated for you. You also get constants
for each accessor (all caps) which return the key into the hash for that
accessor. Single inheritence is also supported.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 PROVIDED BY HASH BASE

=over 4

=item $it = $class->new(@VALUES)

Create a new instance using key/value pairs.

=item $it->import()

This import method is actually provided by L<Test::Stream::Exporter> and allows
you to import the constants generated for you.

=back

=head2 HOOKS

=over 4

=item $self->init()

This gives you the chance to set some default values to your fields. The only
argument is C<$self> with its indexes already set from the constructor.

=back

=head1 ACCESSORS

To generate accessors you list them when using the module:

    use Test::Stream::HashBase accessors => [qw/foo/];

This will generate the following subs in your namespace:

=over 4

=item import()

This will let you import the constants

=item foo()

Getter, used to get the value of the C<foo> field.

=item set_foo()

Setter, used to set the value of the C<foo> field.

=item FOO()

Constant, returs the field C<foo>'s key into the class hashref. This function
is also exported, but only when requested. Subclasses will also get this
function as a constant, not simply a method, that means it is copied into the
subclass namespace.

=back

=head1 SUBCLASSING

You can subclass an existing HashBase class.

    use Test::Stream::HashBase
        base      => 'Another::HashBase::Class',
        accessors => [qw/foo bar baz/],

Once a HashBase class is used as a subclass it is locked and no new fields can
be added. All constants from base classes are added to subclasses
automatically.
