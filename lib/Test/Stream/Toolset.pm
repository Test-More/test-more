=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::Toolset - Helper for writing testing tools

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL CODE WARNING

B<This is an experimental release!> Test-Stream, and all its components are
still in an experimental phase. This dist has been released to cpan in order to
allow testers and early adopters the chance to write experimental new tools
with it, or to add experimental support for it into old tools.

B<PLEASE DO NOT COMPLETELY CONVERT OLD TOOLS YET>. This experimental release is
very likely to see a lot of code churn. API's may break at any time.
Test-Stream should NOT be depended on by any toolchain level tools until the
experimental phase is over.

=head2 BACKWARDS COMPATABILITY SHIM

By default, loading Test-Stream will block Test::Builder and related namespaces
from loading at all. You can work around this by loading the compatability shim
which will populate the Test::Builder and related namespaces with a
compatability implementation on demand.

    use Test::Stream::Shim;
    use Test::Builder;
    use Test::More;

B<Note:> Modules that are experimenting with Test::Stream should NOT load the
shim in their module files. The shim should only ever be loaded in a test file.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides you with tools to write testing tools. It makes your job
of integrating with L<Test::Builder> and other testing tools much easier.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package My::Tester;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Test::Stream::Toolset;

    # Optional, you can just use Exporter if you would like
    use Test::Stream::Exporter;

    # These can come from Test::More, so do not export them by default
    # exports is the Test::Stream::Exporter equivilent to @EXPORT_OK
    exports qw/context done_testing/;

    # These are the API we want to provide, export them by default
    # default_exports is the Test::Stream::Exporter equivilent to @EXPORT
    default_exports qw/my_ok my_note/;

    sub my_ok {
        my ($test, $name) = @_;
        my $ctx = context();

        my @diag;
        push @diag => "'$test' is not true!" unless $test;

        $ctx->ok($test, $name, \@diag);

        return $test ? 1 : 0; # Reduce to a boolean
    }

    sub my_note {
        my ($msg) = @_;
        my $ctx = context();

        $ctx->note($msg);

        return $msg;
    }

    sub done_testing {
        my ($expected) = @_;
        my $ctx = context();
        $ctx->done_testing($expected);
    }

    1;

=head2 TEST-MORE STYLE IMPORT

If you want to be able to pass Test-More arguments such as 'tests', 'skip_all',
and 'no_plan', then use the following:

    package My::Tester;
    use Test::Stream::Exporter;               # Gives us 'import()'
    use Test::Stream::Toolset;                # default exports
    use Test::Stream::Toolset 'before_import' # Test-More style argument support

2 'use' statements were used above for clarity, you can get all the desired
imports at once:

    use Test::Stream::Toolset qw/context init_tester is_tester before_import/;

Then in the test:

    use My::Tester tests => 5;

=head1 EXPORTS

=over 4

=item $ctx = context()

The context() method is used to get the current context, generating one if
necessary. The context object is an instance of L<Test::Stream::Context>, and
is used to generate events suck as C<ok> and C<plan>. The context also knows
what file+line errors should be reported at.

B<WARNING:> Do not directly store the context in anything other than a lexical
variable scoped to your function! As long as there are references to a context
object, C<context()> will return that object. You want the object to be
destroyed at the end of the current scope so that the next function you call
can create a new one. If you need a copy of the context use
C<< $ctx = $ctx->snapshot >>.

=item $meta = init_tester($CLASS)

This method can be used to initialize a class as a test class. In most cases
you do not actually need to use this. If the class is already a tester this
will return the existing meta object.

=item $meta = is_tester($CLASS)

This method can be used to check if an object is a tester. If the object is a
tester it will return the meta object for the tester.

=item before_import

This method is used by C<import()> to parse Test-More style import arguments.
You should never need to run this yourself, it works just by being imported.

B<NOTE:> This will only work if you use Test::Stream::Exporter for your
'import' method.

=back

=head1 GENERATING EVENTS

Events are always generated via a context object.

=over 4

=item L<Test::Stream::Event::Ok>

    $ctx->ok($bool, $name, \@diag)

Ok events are your actual assertions. You assert that a condition is what you
expect. It is recommended that you name your assertions. You can include an
array of diag objects and/or diagniostics strings that will be printed to
STDERR as comments in the event of a failure.

=item L<Test::Stream::Event::Diag>

    $ctx->diag($MESSAGE)

Produce an independant diagnostics message.

=item L<Test::Stream::Event::Note>

    $ctx->note($MESSAGE)

Produce a note, that is a message that is printed to STDOUT as a comment.

=item L<Test::Stream::Event::Plan>

    $ctx->plan($MAX, $DIRECTIVE, $REASON)

This will set the plan. C<$MAX> should be the number of tests you expect to
run. You may set this to 0 for some plan directives. Examples of directives are
C<'skip_all'> and C<'no_plan'>. Some directives have an additional argument
called C<$REASON> which is aptly named as the reason for the directive.

=item L<Test::Stream::Event::Bail>

    $ctx->bail($MESSAGE)

In the event of a catostrophic failure that should terminate the test file, use
this event to stop everything and print the reason.

=item L<Test::Stream::Event::Finish>

=item L<Test::Stream::Event::Subtest>

These are not intended for public use, but are documented for completeness.

=back

=head1 MODIFYING EVENTS

If you want to make changes to event objects before they are processed, you can
add a munger. The return from a munger is ignored, you must make your changes
directly to the event object.

    Test::Stream->shared->munge(sub {
        my ($hub, $event) = @_;
        ...
    });

B<Note:> every munger is called for every event of every type. There is also no
way to remove a munger. For performance reasons it is best to only ever add one
munger per toolset which dispatches according to events and state.

=head1 LISTENING FOR EVENTS

If you wish to know when an event has occured so that you can do something
after it has been processed, you can add a listener. Your listener will be
called for every single event that occurs, after it has been processed. The
return from a listener is ignored.

    Test::Stream->shared->listen(sub {
        my ($hub, $event) = @_;
        ...
    });

B<Note:> every listener is called for every event of every type. There is also no
way to remove a listener. For performance reasons it is best to only ever add one
listener per toolset which dispatches according to events and state.

=head1 I WANT TO EMBED FUNCTIONALITY FROM TEST::MORE

Take a look at L<Test::More::Tools> which provides an interfaces to the code in
Test::More. You can use that library to produce booleans and diagnostics
without actually triggering events, giving you the opportunity to generate your
own.

=head1 FROM TEST::BUILDER TO TEST::HUB

This is a list of things people used to override in Test::Builder, and the new
API that should be used instead of overrides.

=over 4

=item ok

=item note

=item diag

=item plan

In the past people would override these methods on L<Test::Builder>.
L<Test::Stream> now provides a proper API for handling all event types.

Anything that used to be done via overrides can now be done using
c<Test::Stream->shared->listen(sub { ... })> and
C<Test::Stream->shared->munge(sub { ... })>, which are documented above.

=item done_testing

In the past people have overriden C<done_testing()> to insert some code between
the last test and the final plan. The proper way to do this now is with a
follow_up hook.

    Test::Stream->shared->follow_up(sub {
        my ($context) = @_;
        ...
    });

There are multiple ways that follow_ups will be triggered, but they are
guarenteed to only be called once, at the end of testing. This will either be
the start of C<done_testing()>, or an END block called after your tests are
complete.

=head1 HOW DO I TEST MY TEST TOOLS?

See L<Test::Stream::Tester>. This library gives you all the tools you need to
test your testing tools.
