=head1 NAME

Test::Stream::Concurrency - Enable concurrency in Test::Stream.

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL CODE WARNING

B<This is an experimental release!> Test-Stream, and all its components are
still in an experimental phase. This dist has been released to cpan in order to
allow testers and early adopters the chance to write experimental new tools
with it, or to add experimental support for it into old tools.

B<PLEASE DO NOT COMPLETELY CONVERT OLD TOOLS YET>. This experimental release is
very likely to see a lot of code churn. API's may break at any time.
Test-Stream should NOT be depended on by any toolchain level tools until the
experimental phase is over.

=head2 BACKWARDS COMPATABILITY SHIM

By default, loading Test-Stream will block Test::Builder and related namespaces
from loading at all. You can work around this by loading the compatability shim
which will populate the Test::Builder and related namespaces with a
compatability implementation on demand.

    use Test::Stream::Shim;
    use Test::Builder;
    use Test::More;

B<Note:> Modules that are experimenting with Test::Stream should NOT load the
shim in their module files. The shim should only ever be loaded in a test file.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

This *just works* for nearly all cases and environments:

    use Test::Stream::Concurrency;

    ...

By default this loads the L<Test::Stream::Concurrency::Files> driver. The
default may change at any time in the future, so if you care what driver is
used then you must specify it.

=head2 JOIN AND WAIT

Join and wait are turned on by default:

    use Test::Stream::Concurrency;

is the same as

    use Test::Stream::Concurrency join => 1, wait => 1;

You can also request they be disabled:

    use Test::Stream::Concurrency join => 0, wait => 0;

If you do not want to enable them, but do want to allow something else to
enable them, you can set them to undef. This is how Legacy support works:

    use Test::Stream::Concurrency join => undef, wait => undef;

=head2 SPECIFYING DRIVERS

    use Test::Stream::Concurrency(
        driver   => 'My::Concurrency::Driver',
        fallback => 'My::Concurrency::Fallback',
        fallback => 'My::Concurrency::Fallback2',
    );

You can also specify a default driver via the C<$TS_CONCURRENCY_DRIVER>
environment variable:

    $ TS_CONCURRENCY_DRIVER='My::Concurrency::Driver' prove my_test.t

The environment variable value is ignored if a driver is specified in code.

Directly using a driver will attempt to load it as the driver. That is to say
that these 2 use statements are identical:

    use Test::Stream::Concurrency driver => 'My::Concurrency::Driver';
    use My::Concurrency::Driver;

=head1 DEFINED CONCURRENCY BEHAVIOR

How some test tools should act under concurrency is not always clear. This
section outlines some edge cases, and how they are handled by
Test::Stream::Concurrency.

=head2 WAIT, JOIN, and BACKCOMPAT

By Default Test::Stream::Concurrency loads with C<wait> and C<join> enabled.
These behaviors will cause the parent process to wait for all child process or
threads before exiting. This behavior is helpful and prevents you from making
common mistakes.

Legacy thread support and Test::SharedFork did not provide either of these
behaviors, so in purely backwards compatible mode they are not loaded. This
happens when concurrency is enabled automatically because C<threads> are
loaded, or when you load Test::SharedFork. Loading L<Test::Stream::Concurrency>
at any point will turn these features on unless you ask to turn them off.

=head2 ENDING THE PARENT PROCESS

=head3 PARENT ENDS BEFORE CHILD PROCESS

If this happens, and C<wait> is not set, the child process will provide a
helpful warning, and send a 'not ok' to stdout in hopes the harness will notice
it and record a test failure. It is possible a harness could miss this
resulting in a false-pass. This is the primary reason for the C<wait> option,
and why it is on by default.

=head3 PARENT ENDS BEFORE CHILD THREAD

If this happens, and C<join> is not set, perl simply ends the child thread and
prints a message telling you it was running. There is no way for the child
thread to alert the harness that something went wrong. This usually results in
a false-pass. This is the primary reason for the C<join> option, and why it is
on by default.

=head2 SUBTESTS

=head3 STARTING A CHILD BEFORE A SUBTEST

This simply did not work in legacy code. It now works as expected, the subtest
runs in the child process, the result is sent to the parent. In Legacy code
this would fail because test numbers and plans would be wrong.

=head3 STARTING A CHILD INSIDE A SUBTEST

In legacy code this worked fine so long as you waited or joined before the
subtest ended, failing to wait or join could result in false-passes.

With Test::Stream this just works as expected. You still need to wait or join
before the parent process finishes the subtest. If you fail to wait/join you
will get a helpful error message and a test failure.

=head2 DEMOS

This dist comes with a set of demonstration scripts in C<./concurrency_demos/>.
These scripts demonstrate most of the edge cases, and how they are handled in
modern or legacy Test-Simple dists. The output of each script can be found
under the __END__ section inside each script.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over

=item $bool = $sync->wait;

This is true if Test::Stream should wait on all child processes before exiting.
This can be modified using the C<< $sync->configure >> method.

=item $bool = $sync->join;

This is true if Test::Stream should join on all child threads before exiting.
This can be modified using the C<< $sync->configure >> method.

=item %config = $sync->configure()

=item $sync->configure(wait => $wbool, join => $jbool)

Used to get/set the configuration. Currently the configuration contains 2 keys:
C<join> and C<wait>.

=head1 WRITING DRIVERS

    package My::Concurrency::Driver;
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use base 'Test::Stream::Concurrency';

    # Checks to verify this driver works in the current environment
    sub is_viable {
        return 1 unless $^O ne 'SUPPORTED_PLATFORM';
        return 1 unless $ENV{NO_DRIVER};
        return 0;
    }

    sub send {
        my $self = shift;
        my %params = @_;

        # arrayrefs with process-id and thread-id
        my $dest = $params{dest}; # where to send the events
        my $orig = $params{orig}; # usually current proc-id and thread-id

        # arrayref of events to send
        my $events = $param{events};

        ... # Here is where you send the events to the other thread/proc
    }

    sub cull {
        my $self = shift;

        # This tells us the pid and thread id we think we are, only cull
        # results intended for this combination.
        my ($pid, $tid) = @_; # proc-id and thread-id

        my @events = ...; # Here is where you get the events

        return @events;
    }

    1;

=head2 METHODS SUBCLASSES MUST IMPLEMENT

=over 4

=item $class->is_viable()

This must be a class method. This method should return true if the concurrency
driver is expected to work in the current environment. If the concurrency driver
is not viable in the current environment it should return 0.

    sub is_viable {
        return 1 unless $^O ne 'SUPPORTED_PLATFORM';
        return 1 unless $ENV{NO_DRIVER};
        return 0;
    }

=item $sync->send(dest => [$DPID, $DTID], orig => [$$, get_tid()], events => \@events);

Used to send events from the current thread/proc to the destination
thread/proc. The C<dest> argument will always be an arrayref with the proc-id
and thread-id to which the events should be sent. The C<orig> argument will
always have the proc-id and thread-id that the events are from, usually the
current pid and tid. The c<events> argument will always be an arrayref of
events to send.

    sub send {
        my $self = shift;
        my %params = @_;

        # arrayrefs with process-id and thread-id
        my $dest = $params{dest}; # where to send the events
        my $orig = $params{orig}; # usually current proc-id and thread-id

        # arrayref of events to send
        my $events = $param{events};

        ... # Here is where you send the events to the other thread/proc
    }

=item @events = $sync->cull($pid, $tid)

This is used to collect results sent by another process or thread. The argument
are the proc-id and thread-id that should be used to identify what events
belong to us, these correspond to the C<dest> argument of C<< $sync->send() >>.
These will usually be the current proc-id and thread-id, but they may not be if
someone is doing something clever.

    sub cull {
        my $self = shift;

        # This tells us the pid and thread id we think we are, only cull
        # results intended for this combination.
        my ($pid, $tid) = @_; # proc-id and thread-id

        my @events = ...; # Here is where you get the events

        return @events;
    }
