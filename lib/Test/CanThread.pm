Test::CanThread - Only run tests when threading is supported, optionally conditioned on ENV vars.

environment variables are not set.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Skip the test if threading is unsupported:

    use Test::CanThread;
    use Test::More;
    ...

Skip the test if threading is unsupported, or any of the specified env vars are
not set:

    use Test::CanThread qw/AUTHOR_TESTING RUN_PROBLEMATIC_TESTS .../;
    use Test::More;
    ...
