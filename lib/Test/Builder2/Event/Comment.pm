=head1 NAME

Test::Builder2::Event::Comment - an event representing a comment

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An event representing a comment to be added to the formatted output.
This only makes sense in those formats which support comments like TAP
or XML.

This is different from a logging event in that it should never be shown
to the user unless they're looking at the raw formatter output.
