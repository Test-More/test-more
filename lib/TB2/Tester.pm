=head1 NAME

TB2::Tester - Testing a Test:: module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::More;
    use Your::Test::Module qw(thing_ok that_ok);
    use TB2::Tester;

    my $capture = capture {
        thing_ok $thing, "some name";
        that_ok $that;
    };

    my $results = $capture->results;

    # The first one passed, and it has a name
    result_like shift @$capture, {
        is_pass => 1,
        name => "some name",
    };

    # The second one failed, and it has no name
    result_like shift @$capture, {
        is_pass => 0,
        name => ''
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a module for testing Test modules.

=head2 Exports

These are exported by default

=head3 capture

    my $capture = capture { ...test code ... };

Captures all the events and results which happens inside the block.

Returns a L<TB2::History> that you can reference later.
This is disassociated from any other tests, so you do what you like to
it without altering any other tests.

=cut

sub capture(&) {
    my $code = shift;

    require TB2::TestState;
    my $state = TB2::TestState->default;
    my $our_ec = $state->push_coordinator;

    $our_ec->clear_formatters;
    $our_ec->history( TB2::History->new( store_events => 1 ) );

    my($ret, $err) = $CLASS->try(sub { $code->(); 1; });

    $state->pop_coordinator;

    die $err if $err;

    return $our_ec->history;
}

=head3 event_like

  event_like( $event, $want );
  event_like( $event, $want, $name );

Tests that a $result looks like what you $want.

$want is a hash ref of keys and values.  Each of these will be checked
against the $result's attributes.  For example...

    result_like( $result, { name => "foo" } );

will check that C<< $result->name eq "foo" >>.

Values can also be regular expressions.

    result_like( $result, { name => qr/foo/ } );

will check that C<< $result->name =~ /foo/ >>.

=cut

install_test event_like => sub($$;$) {
    my($have, $want, $name) = @_;

    $name ||= "event: ".($want->{event_type} || $have->event_type);

    my $ok = 1;
    for my $key (keys %$want) {
        my $have_val = $CLASS->try(sub { $have->$key });
        my $want_val = $want->{$key};

        $ok &= ref $want_val ? $have_val =~ $want_val
             :                 $have_val eq $want_val;
    }

    return Builder->ok($ok, $name);
};


=head3 result_like

  result_like( $result, $want );
  result_like( $result, $want, $name );

Works just as C<event_like> but it also checks the $result is a result.

=cut

install_test result_like => sub($$;$) {
    my($have, $want, $name) = @_;

    $name ||= "result: ".($want->{name} || $have->name || '');
    return Builder->ok(0, $name) if $have->event_type ne 'result';

    return event_like($have, $want, $name);
};

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Avoid hardcoding the test sequence

    my $results = $history->results;
    result_like $results->[0], {
        is_pass => 0,
        name    => "this is that",
        file    => $0,
    };
    result_like $results->[1], { ... }
    result_like $results->[2], { ... }

The drawback with using array indices to access individual results
is that once you decide to add or remove a test from any place but
the very end of the test list, your array indices will be wrong and
you'll have to update them all.

To preclude this issue from arising, simply C<shift> the individual
results off the result list, like this:

    result_like shift @$results, { ... }; # check first result
    result_like shift @$results, { ... }; # next one, and so on

Now you only have to add checks symmetrically with your new tests -
existing lines won't have to be edited.  It's safe to modify $results
because it is only the results for your captured tests.
