=head1 NAME

TB2::TestState - Object which holds the state of the test

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use TB2::TestState;

    # Get the state of the default test.
    # Usually you'd ask your builder for the TestState object,
    # but we'll get it directly.
    my $state = TB2::TestState->default;

    # Post an event, like an EventCoordinator
    $state->post_event($event);

    # Get the history of the test
    my $history = $state->history;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

All test state resides not in the builder objects but in the TestState
and its attached L<TB2::EventHandler> objects.  TestState
holds onto the current event handlers and passes events along to them.
It also manages subtest state.

For example, when a builder has generated a Result object, it should
post it to the TestState.

    $state->post_event($result);

TestState does everything a L<TB2::EventCoordinator> does.
It delegates to a stack of EventCoordinators, one for each layer of
subtesting.

TestState has a default object to hold the state of the default
test.  Builders should use C<< TB2::TestState->default >>
to get the TestState if they want to play nice with others.  You can
also create your own test states with
C<<TB2::TestState->create >>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructors

Because TestState is a default, it does not provide a B<new> to
avoid confusion.  It instead has B<create> and B<default>.

=head3 create

    my $state = TB2::TestState->create(%event_coordinator_args);

Create a new test state.

C<%event_coordinator_args> are passed to the constructor when it
creates new event coordinators.  This lets you pass in different
formatters and handlers.

    # Make a test state with no formatter
    my $state = TB2::TestState->create(
        formatters => []
    );


=head3 default

    my $state = TB2::TestState->default;

Retrieve the shared TestState.

You should use this if you want to coordinate with other test libraries.

=cut

# Override create() to add the first coordinator.
# Mouse attributes don't provide enough flexibility to have both a default
# and the trigger to do the delegation.
sub create {
    my $class = shift;
    my %args = @_;

    # Roles inject methods, so we can't call SUPER. :(
    my $self = $class->TB2::Mouse::Object::new(@_);

    # Store our constructor arguments
    $self->_coordinator_constructor_args(\%args);

    $self->push_coordinator;

    return $self;
}


sub make_default {
    my $class = shift;
    my $state = $class->create;
    return $state->shared_clone($state);
}

=head2 Misc

=head3 object_id

    my $id = $thing->object_id;

Returns an identifier for this object unique to the running process.
The identifier is fairly simple and easily predictable.

See L<TB2::HasObjectID>


=head2 EventCoordinator methods

TestState delegates to a stack of EventCoordinators.  It does all the
methods of L<TB2::EventCoordinator>.


=head2 Stack management

TestState maintains state in a stack of EventCoordinators.  Each item
in the stack is isolated from another (unless they decide to share
EventHandlers).

One can add a coordinator to the stack to set up an isolated test
state and remove it to restore the original state.  This is useful
both for testing tests (see L<TB2::Tester>) and for running
subtests in isolation.

=head3 push_coordinator

    my $event_coordinator = $state->push_coordinator;
    my $event_coordinator = $state->push_coordinator($event_coordinator);

Add an $event_coordinator to the stack.  This will become the new delegate.

If an $event_coordinator is not passed in, a new one will be made using
the arguments originally passed into L<create>.

=cut

sub push_coordinator {
    my $self = shift;

    my $ec;
    if( !@_ ) {
        my $coordinator_class = $self->coordinator_class;
        $self->load( $coordinator_class );

        $ec = $coordinator_class->new( %{ $self->_coordinator_constructor_args } );
    }
    else {
        $ec = shift;
    }

    $ec = $self->shared_clone($ec);
    push @{ $self->_coordinators }, $ec; 

    # Do the delegation every time we add a new coordinator in case it's
    # a subclass that added methods.
    $self->_delegate_to_current_coordinator;

    return $ec;
}


=head3 pop_coordinator

    my $event_coordinator = $state->pop_coordinator;

This will remove the current coordinator from the stack.  Test state
will be delegated to the coordinator below it.

An exception will be thrown if the final coordinator is attempted to
be removed.

=cut

sub pop_coordinator {
    my $self = shift;

    my $coordinators = $self->_coordinators;
    croak "The last coordinator cannot be popped" if @$coordinators == 1;

    return pop @$coordinators;
}


=head3 current_coordinator

    my $ec = $state->current_coordinator;

Returns the current L<TB2::EventCoordinator> which is being
delegated to.
