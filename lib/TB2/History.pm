=head1 NAME

TB2::History - Manage the history of test results

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use TB2::History;

    my $history = TB2::History->new;
    my $ec = TB2::EventCoordinator->create(
        history => $history
    );

    my $pass  = TB2::Result->new_result( pass => 1 );
    $ec->post_event( $pass );
    $ec->history->can_succeed;   # true

    my $result  = TB2::Result->new_result( pass => 0 );
    $ec->post_event( $pass );
    $ec->history->can_succeed;   # false


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object stores and manages the history of test results.

It is a L<TB2::EventHandler>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructors

=head3 new

    my $history = TB2::History->new;

Creates a new, unique History object.

=head2 Accessors

Unless otherwise stated, these are all accessor methods of the form:

    my $value = $history->method;       # get
    $history->method($value);           # set


=head2 Events

=head3 events

A TB2::Stack of events, that include Result objects.

=head3 event_count

Get the count of events that are on the stack.

=head2 Results

=head3 results

A TB2::Stack of Result objects.

    # The result of test #4.
    my $result = $history->results->[3];

}
sub result_count     { shift->results_count }


=head2 result_count

Get the count of results stored in the stack. 

NOTE: This could be diffrent from the number of tests that have been
seen, to get that count use test_count.

=head3 has_results

Returns true if we have stored results, false otherwise.

=cut

sub has_results { shift->result_count > 0 }


=head2 Statistics

=cut

# %statistic_mapping: 
# attribute_name => code_ref that defines how to increment attribute_name
#
# this is used both as a list of attributes to create as well as by 
# _update_statistics to increment the attribute. 
# code_ref will be handed a single result object that was to be added
# to the results stack.

    pass_count

    todo_count

    $self->skip_count( $self->skip_count + 1 ) if $result->is_skip;
    $self->test_count( $self->test_count + 1 );

    return;
}


=head3 test_count

A count of the number of tests that have been added to results. This
value is not guaranteed to be the same as results_count if you have
altered the results_stack. This is a static counter of the number of
tests that have been seen, not the number of results stored.

=head3 pass_count

A count of the number of passed tests have been added to results.

=head3 fail_count

A count of the number of failed tests have been added to results.

=head3 todo_count

A count of the number of TODO tests have been added to results.

=head3 skip_count

A count of the number of SKIP tests have been added to results.

=head3 can_succeed

Returns true if the test can still succeed.  That is, if nothing yet
has happened to cause it to fail and the plan can be fulfilled.

For example, running too few tests is ok, but if too many have been
run the test can never succeed.

In another example, if there is no plan yet issued, there is no plan
to violate.

=cut

sub can_succeed {
    my $self = shift;

    return 0 if $self->abort;

    # Testing is done, do the full check.
    return $self->test_was_successful if $self->done_testing;

    # A test failed.
    return 0 if $self->fail_count > 0;

    # If there's no plan yet, we can't have violated it.
    if( my $plan = $self->plan ) {
        if( my $expect = $plan->asserts_expected ) {
            # We ran more tests than the plan
            return 0 if $self->test_count > $expect;
        }
        elsif( $plan->skip ) {
            # We were supposed to skip everything, but we ran tests
            return 0 if $self->test_count;
        }
    }

    return 1;
}

=head3 test_was_successful

    my $test_passed = $history->test_was_successful;

This returns true if the test is considered successful, false otherwise.

The conditions for a test passing are...

* test_start, set_plan and test_end events were seen
* the plan is satisfied (the right number of Results were seen)
* no Results were seen out of order according to their test_number
* For every Result, is_fail() is false
* If asked at END time, the test process is exiting with 0

Note that this will not be true until C<test_end> has been seen.
Until then, use C<can_succeed>.

=cut

    my $self = shift;

    return 0 if $self->abort;

    # We're still testing
