=item ($ok, $err) = try_sig_mask { ... }

Complete an action with several signals masked, they will be unmasked at the
end allowing any signals that were intercepted to get handled.

This is primarily used when you need to make several actions atomic (against
some signals anyway).

Signals that are intercepted:
