=head1 NAME

Test2::Formatter - Namespace for formatters.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the namespace for formatters. This is an empty package.

=head1 CREATING FORMATTERS

A formatter is any package or object with a C<write($event, $num)> method.

    package Test2::Formatter::Foo;
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    sub write {
        my $self_or_class = shift;
        my ($event, $assert_num) = @_;
        ...
    }

    sub hide_buffered { 1 }

    1;

The C<write> method is a method, so it either gets a class or instance. The two
arguments are the C<$event> object it should record, and the C<$assert_num>
which is the number of the current assertion (ok), or the last assertion if
this even is not itself an assertion. The assertion number may be any integer 0
or greater, and may be undefined in some cases.

The C<hide_buffered()> method must return a boolean. This is used to tell
buffered subtests whether or not to send it events as they are being buffered.
See L<Test2::API/"run_subtest(...)"> for more information.
